# Dev_intestine_evo

Scripts and resources for the manuscript titled as Recent evolution of the developing human intestine impacts metabolic and barrier functions (Yu, Kilik, Secchia et al)

## Introduction
DEG_and_DAR: scripts to identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially accessible regions (DARs) between human, chimpanzee and mouse.

Data_preprocessing_integration_and_annotation: scripts to construct customized reference for read alignments where applicable, preprocessing, integration and cell type annotation for scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data.

Deep_learning: scripts to perform sequence variation modeling based on ChromBPNet and the derived models.

Evolutionary_force: scripts and resources for deepest evolutionary ancestry assignment for regulatory elements and calculation of dN/dS.

Plotting: plotting scripts, including script to generate willow plot for visualization of hierarchy of enriched GO terms and parent terms and coverage plots with overlapping genomic signature.

scSTARRseq: scripts to construct customized reference for read alignments, preprocessing and downstream analysis.

## Development and maintaince
In this manuscript, Stefano Secchia established the workflow for scSTARRseq data analysis, [Christiana Fauci](https://github.com/cfauci) established the workflow for deepest evolutionary ancestry assignment; [Jasper Janssens](https://github.com/jjans5) established the workflow of deep learning. [Qianhui Yu](https://github.com/qianhuiyu) established the other workflows and are responsible for the maintenance.
